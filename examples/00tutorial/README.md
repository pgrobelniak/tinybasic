# BASIC tutorial, the commands and the language sets

## Programs 

### Palo Alto BASIC language set

This is the minimal BASIC language set also found in many Tinybasic adaptions. The orginal language was described in a Dr. Dobbs Article. It has the commands PRINT, LET, INPUT, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, IF, FOR, TO, STEP, NEXT, STOP, LIST, NEW, RUN, ABS, INT, RND, SIZE, REM. Note that there is no THEN in Palo Alto BASIC. This is what you get when compiling with #define BASICMINIMAL. INT, LOAD, and SAVE were not present in Palo Alto BASIC but added here nevertheless.

- Hello World: hello.bas - say hello.
- Table: table.bas - print a formatted table of values.
- Random: random.bas - create random number and show the distribution of them.
- Sort: sort.bas - sort a list of random numbers
- TicTacToe: tictac.bas - play tictactoe against the computer who moves first.
- EEPROM: eeprom.bas - store data to the EEPROM array and access it later

### Apple 1 Integer BASIC language set

The Apple 1 language set has arrays, strings and a number of additional commands. It is compatible to Apple Integer BASIC. Additional commands are NOT, AND, OR, LEN, SGN, PEEK, POKE, DIM, THEN, TAB, END, CLR, HIMEM. 

- Memory: memory.bas - access BASIC memory with PEEK and POKE, find memory layout
- Array: array.bas - array code test program, including @() and @E()
- String1: string1.bas - string constants and variables
- String2: string2.bas - substrings, splitting and concatenating
- String3: string3.bas - characters and strings
- String4: string4.bas - string arrays 
- Logic: logic.bas - boolean expressions
- Parable: parable.bas - draws a parable using TAB to format output

### Stefan's extension

These are a set of useful commands and features missing in Apple Integer BASIC. Some of then I took from other BASIC interpreters, some I missed in the past and added with different features. Commands in this language set are CONT, SQR, POW, MAP, DUMP, BREAK, GET, PUT, SET, CLS, USR, CALL, ELSE.

- StopCont: stopcont.bas - stop and continue a running program
- Euler9: euler9.bas - solve the Euler 9 number theory problem
- Loops: loop.bas - demo for loops in BASIC including while, until constructs
- Conditions: cond.bas - demo for conditions 
- Mathematics: math.bas - demo for square root, powers, and mapping
- Primes: primes.bas - caclulate N prime numbers 
- Primes Loop: primesl.bas - caclulate N prime numbers using special features of BASIC
- Hardware Information: hinv.bas - display the internals of BASIC
- Small Hinv: shinv.bas - display the essentials of a system
- System Information: sysinf.bas - display the language features of BASIC
- PutGet: putget.bas - output single characters
- Dump: dump.bas - show the BASIC memory
- Debug: debug.bas - switch a program to debug mode
- EndMe: endme.bas - ending / resetting the interpreter
- Fibonacci: fibo.bas - print the Golden ration on an Integer BASIC
- Clock: clock.bas - shows time and date and on Arduinos also the temperature
- Serial1: serial1.bas - read from and write to the second serial port

### Dartmouth extension

For compatibility with the Dartmouth style BASIC interpreters, the following commands have been added const char DATA, READ, RESTORE, DEF, FN, ON.

- ReadData: readdata.bas - reading data 
- OnGo: ongo.bas - demo for ON GOTO type conditions
- Functions: func.bas - demo for DEF FN statements
- Eliza: eliza.bas - the BASIC written psychologist, legendary program from 1979

### File I/O functions

File I/O is supported with the command set CATALOG, OPEN, CLOSE, FDISK, DELETE. 

- FileIO: fileio.bas - write and read a data file 

### Floating point functions 

The classical BASIC floating point functions SIN, COS, TAN, ATAN, LOG, EXP are part of the floating point laguage set.

- Trigonometry: trig.bas - calculate a table of trigonometric functions
- Stirling: stir.bas - caculate factorials and compare to Stirlings function

### The Dark Arts

This language set has a few functions for low level access to the interpreter mechanism. Currently MALLOC, FIND and EVAL are implemented.

- Malloc: malloc.bas - allocate memory and find it by identifier
- Eval: eval.bas - plot a function
- ClrVar: clrvar.bas - delete heap objects

### IoT Extensions 

This language set is work in progress. There are a few string helper functions already finished which will be explained here. The networking and serial protocol features will be explained in another section of the examples tree.

- Convert: convert.bas - convert strings to numbers and vice versa
- Splitstring: splitstr.bas - split a string into substrings

### More programs to play with

- Calculator: calc.bas - RPN pocket calculator in BASIC

### More BASIC features

In addition to these language sets there are the Arduino IO functions. These features are explained in 01basics-10starter.

Graphics functions are ommited here, they will be explained in a special section of the examples code as well.

IoT and networking functions are also explained in a special section.
