# Example programs for from 101 BASIC games

## Sources

Original programs of the book "BASIC Computer Games"

This is an unofficial mirror of the source code provided inside the book **"Basic Computer Games"**, aka **"101 BASIC Computer Games"**, by David H. Ahl, published in 1978. 

The files were taken from http://vintage-basic.net/games.html and ported to Stefan's Tinybasic to see how the interpreter would work. 

The archive itself was a fork from https://github.com/GReaperEx/bcg.

Not all programs are thoroughly tested. Have fun with games from 1975.
